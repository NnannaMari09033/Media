	The reward of dedication and comittment.
	
	In a world filled with corruption people no longer see the need to be committed. it is such a sad thing to witness that the youth of these days no longer see the impact of discipline and commitment. Everyone wants to make money by all mostly ilegal means and the mentality is really affecting the younger generations.
	This author is happy that despite the virus that has infected the youths there are still passionate individuals who are willing to work through the road of success through dedication and commitment. it is said that "hardwork pays" and indeed hardwork truly pays. it may take hours, days, months or years but definietly one day the reward of your labour will get to you! but the sad truth there is that it's only the patient ones that get rewarded.
	Fellows, this author wants to remind you that "whatever that is worth doing is worth doing well" and that it takes self determination and commitment to achieve a greater height! so, be patient and remain focused your reward awaits you!
	

Your's truly,
 
 Mari.
